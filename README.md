Untethered
----------

Untethered is an experiment/adventure in developing a full-fledged website entirely on mobile devices, like an iPad and iPhone.

The project will focus on documenting the process and steps to create the website.

# Rules

+ Apps used can be free or paid for
+ Apps must be available on the app store. No private / development apps
+ Everything from domain, to hosting, to repository must be created and managed on the devices.
+ Debugging / Testing can be a difficult part of developing a website. The majority of the work, should be done on the ipad, but cross browser testing should be allowed on external devices. Making use of browsershots + other web based browser emulators should be a priority.

# Software / Apps

## Coda

Primary development tool, most of the coding will be done inside coda. Available on the app store from @panic

## Working Copy

Handles the git repository work on iOS. Has an internal webdav server to allow Coda to write files to the repo. Available on the App Store.

## Github

Host of the repository as well as host of the website using github pages. Account was not signed up on the ipad, but is doable (Personal account, was already setup). Paid account allows for private repos as well.

## Jekyll

Powers the site on github pages. Is a static site generator allowing content to be created in markdown and then published as html on build. Well supported, and been around for a long time. Great community.ÃŸ
